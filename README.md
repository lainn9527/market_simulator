# Financail market simulation with multiple deep reinforcement learning agents
The financial market simulator based on [Scaling and criticality in a stochastic multi-agent model of a financial market](https://www.nature.com/articles/17290),
and I extend the market with call auction and the agents with deep reinforcement learning.

## Use
Set up the configures before the simulation.

```
# normal agent
python simulator.py

# deep reinforcement learning agents
python multi_simulator.py
```
